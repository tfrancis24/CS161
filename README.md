C++ Coding Assignments for Computer Science I at Portland Community College

I will upload some of my prior lab work and assignments from this course
Lab work will consist of code that is done in class (or at home if not completed) and the assignments are
the homework projects done on my own

All code for this class was built using the Visual Studio IDE
