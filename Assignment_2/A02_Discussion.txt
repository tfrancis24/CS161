- Unnamed vars 
	Miles per gallon formula
	Liters per kilometer formula

- Input data needed by the user
	Starting mileage, ending mileage, starting fuel, ending fuel.

- Output data 
	Miles traveled, km traveled, gallons of fuel used, liters of fuel used, miles per gallon, and liters per km.

- How will input data be transformed into output data?
	The program will calculate the differece between the starting mileage and fuel used and the ending ones and
	use the difference as the output data to the user. It will calculate the miles per gallon by dividing the total miles output by total gallons.
	It will repeat the process for the metric output by multiplying by the constants.
