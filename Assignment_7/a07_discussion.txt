1. What are the named variables you will use?  List their names, data types, and purpose.
	const int MAX used to hold the max value for arrays
	string names[] String array used to store students names
	double scores[][] 2D array used to store student scores
	char grades[] char aray used to store students letter grades
	ifstream inFile variable to read file input
	double total used to store total scores for a student
	int avg used to calc student avg
	int i counter variable
	int j counter variable for 2D arrays
	int size counter variable for how many times loop runs

2. What are the unnamed variables you will use?  List their data type and purpose.
	The logic of how to calculate averages

3. What input data is needed by the program
	The text file
	Student names
	Student Scores

4. What output data is generated by the prorgam?
	Student names and student scores
	Students letter grades
	The class average score

5. Describe how the input data will be transformed into the output data.
	The program will open the text file and get data from the rile.
	It will store the data in multiple arrays using for loops to get the scores.
	After that, the program will output the contents of the arrays to the screen.
	The program will run through the arrays using loops to calculate the students letter grades and then the class average score.
